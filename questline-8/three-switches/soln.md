Take three switches 1,2 and 3 which are placed in a room. 
To check which switch controls it:
1. I will turn 1 on and wait for sometime. After that turn off and
2. Then I will turn 2 on and go into the room where the bulb is kept.
3. If the bulb is glowing, then switch 2 is operating it.
4. If the bulb is not glowing, touch it, if it is hot then switch 1 operates it.
5. else it is switch 3 which will operate the bulb.
