I got this answer by following the rules of sudoku; i.e, numbers in a row and column should not repeat and there should be distinct no.s in the 2x2 part.
I started with 1 at the first place, because the rule will be violated if I do so. Then followed by 2 and 3.
In the second row, I had an option for placing 2 and 4 after checking the first rule but placing 2 over there will violate the 2nd rule.
By following the first rule I kept 2 in the other blank.
In the third row, 2nd position, only 4 is left to get a position in that column. In the next 2 spaces I filled 1 and 2 because by doing so, the column rule is not violated.
I filled the remaining slots with remaining no.s column wise.i.e; 2,4,3
